### Publishing made easier

React Native and Flutter are both solid ways to build apps that run on multiple platforms. Both have good paths to get there. For me, React Native is more interesting because I already know JavaScript and TypeScript. Plus, I know how React works pretty well, so jumping into React Native feels natural. If you’re a web developer with React experience, it’s an easy choice.
Flutter does give more control over the UI and offers good performance without relying on native components. Flutter uses Dart as its programming language, and it is relatively easy to pick up if you are familiar with object-oriented programming. If your app is mainly for mobile users, Flutter might be the better fit.
Ultimately, every app has its unique use case, and React Native or Flutter could be a suitable choice. Just go with what fits your project best.
